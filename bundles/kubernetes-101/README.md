## Request Support for Your Event

Office hours (optional) can be added and scheduled after we obtain questions from community organizers and running them by the content creator. As an organizer, you are encouraged to work with your Google regional lead or community manager to figure out ways the Developer Relations team can support your event. 

## Provide Feedback

How can we improve? Please let us know what’s helpful and what we can do better by providing feedback through the dedicated surveys. Here's how:

### For Google Developer Groups

Register your event on developers.google.com/events using the correct event tags (gContent, Kubernetes)

You will receive an automated email with  personalized links to the surveys.

### For GDEs and All Other Content Bundle Users

Answer a couple of questions before the workshop through [this survey](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1CJ4Q0Ai8R84dHazOV5rNH34nFyWOGiEk7lthQudbKpA/).
 
Take the final survey after the workshop to [evaluate](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1689NhgwHNfhd6p8dOSlc6xHBU3OR-OBbapGJp6PHHps/edit) the content. 

Please share those 2 links with your participants, if any, as well.
